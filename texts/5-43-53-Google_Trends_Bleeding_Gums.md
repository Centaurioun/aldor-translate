"Bleeding Gums Interest Level Analysis with Google Trends Data 
Introduction 
Online search engines provide users with access to diverse sources of information, including health-related information [1 
]. Google, the most popular search engine, is preferred for obtaining information on health issues such as oral and dental health problems [2–4]. 
Google Trends 
 ( 
GT 
) is a free website owned by Google that combines internet users' search trends with time and 
 geographical location parameters. While  
GT 
 is widely used in marketing, sales, and advertising, it is also used in scientific studies based on analyzing data on oral and dental health [5-8]. 
Periodontal diseases are chronic inflammatory diseases that deve 
lop due to pathogenic microorganisms in the mouth. These diseases are characterized by the destruction of the periodontal tissues surrounding and supporting the teeth, and usually do not cause pain. In this situation, individuals may not perceive the need  
for treatment. Therefore, diagnosis by a physician is crucial, but the patient's awareness of periodontal diseases is also critical for the success of treatment. Gingival bleeding is considered an indicator of active tissue destruction due to periodontal  
disease and 
 can be self-detected by patients [9–11]. Deng et al. reported that gingival bleeding, which can be detected during tooth brushing at home, is an important indicator of the activity of periodontal diseases [12]. 
Seasonal changes can have  
important effects on mental health and behavior. Studies have shown that suicide rates may vary depending on the season [13]. It has also been observed that people tend to exhibit more sedentary behaviors during the winter months compared to the summer mon 
ths [14]. Based on this information, it is possible that seasonal variables may also affect self-care practices, which are critical for preventing periodontal diseases. 
This study is based on the hypothesis that the search volume for the term "bleeding gum 
s" on Google in Turkey differs according to seasonal periods and is influenced by demographic and economic variables. The aim of the study is to determine the search volume for the term "bleeding  
gums" on the internet using  
GT 
 and to examine the possible s 
easonal, demographic, and economic effects on this trend. To achieve this, we investigate the possible relationship between geographical, economic, and social factors and the search trend for the term "bleeding gums" among internet users in Turkey. 
In conc 
lusion, this study makes a valuable contribution to the field of oral and dental health by analyzing the search trend for the term "bleeding gums" on the internet using  
GT 
 data and identifying its relationship with seasonal, demographic, and economic facto 
rs. By doing so, it aims to provide information for the development of health services and policies and increase awareness about oral and dental health. 
Methods and Methods 
Design of the study: 
This study is cross-sectional and analyzes the trend of search 
es for the term "bleeding gums" in Turkey. In addition, the study investigates the seasonal, demographic, and economic factors that affect this trend. For this purpose, data from 5 years were obtained from  
GT 
 ( 
https://trends.google.com/trends 
), the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat), and the Turkish Ministry of Health (TCSB) websites, which were used for data analysis. It is worth noting that the study has focused on  
data analysis and does not require approval from an ethics committee. 
Data collection: 
In order to investigate the level of interest in the term "bleeding gums," the  
GT 
 search engine was used. The data were filtered based on Turkey and the date range between 01.01.2017 and 31.12.2021. The data were recorded weekly, and the relative search volume of the annual data was calculated by taking the arithmetic mean.

"e with the highest interest in the relevant term was considered 100. Subsequently, relative search volume values were determined compared to other provinces. Demographic and economic vari 
ables were recorded using the most recent data from TurkStat and TCSB. GDP, population data, and the number of  
illiterate people were obtained from TURKSTAT data. On the other hand, the number of dental visits and the number of dental visits per capita wer 
e obtained from TCSB data. 
Statistical analysis: 
The statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 24 package program. Descriptive statistics were given as a number, percentage, arithmetic mean, and standard deviation. The normal distribution of numer 
ical variables was evaluated by the  
Shapiro-Wilk 
 test. For non-normally distributed numerical variables, multiple and pairwise comparisons were performed with the  
Friedman 
 test,  
Wilcoxon signed rank 
 test,  
Kruskal- 
Wallis 
 test, and  
Mann-Whitney U 
 test, respe 
ctively. The correlation between variables was analyzed by the  
Spearman 
 correlation analysis. The statistical significance level was accepted as p < 0.05. 
Results 
Table 1 shows the quarterly and annual averages of the 5-year interest level for the term "bleeding gums" between 2017 and 2021. It was found that the lowest relative search volume was significantly lower in 2017 compared to other years (p = 0.00 for all y 
ears). The highest relative search volume was in 2021, but this volume value was  
similar to 
 the others (p > 0.05). 
When the quarterly data were analyzed, the relative search volume for the term "bleeding gums" was significantly lower in Q3 compared to othe 
r quarters in 2021, 2020 and 2018 (Q1-Q3 p = 0.01, Q2-Q3 p = 0.04, Q4-Q3 p = 0.01; Q1-Q3 p = 0.04, Q2-Q3 p = 0.04, Q4-Q3 p = 0.01 for 2020; Q1-Q3 p = 0.00, Q2-Q3 p = 0.00, Q4-Q3 p = 0.01 for 2018). Similarly, the relative search volume of Q3 was lower in 2 
019 compared to other quarters, but this difference was not statistically significant (p >0.05) (Table 1). 
Table 2 shows the 5-year distribution of the level of interest by provinces and the TurkStat and TCSB data for these provinces. During the 5-year per 
iod, interest in the term "bleeding gums" was detected in only 24 out of 81 provinces. The highest and lowest search volumes belonged to Balikesir and Şanliurfa provinces, respectively. 
Table 3 shows the results of the relationship between the 5-year relat 
ive search volume of the term "bleeding gums" for the provinces and TURKSTAT and TCSB data. None of the TurkStat and TCSB data were found to be associated with the relative search volume of the term "bleeding gums" for 5 years (p > 0.05). 
Discussion 
Nowada 
ys, internet sites are a common source of information about health issues. However, the accuracy and reliability of this information can be problematic. Moreover, even if the information is accurate, many people lack the necessary knowledge to interpret it 
 properly [15]. Factors such as individual differences and societal dynamics can influence people's tendency to search for health information. 
A data analysis tool called  
GT 
 is often used to determine users' interest in health-related topics. It is a usefu 
l method for predicting diseases and epidemics, and for monitoring changes in user interest over time and across regions [16-18]. 
In this cross-sectional study, we used  
GT 
 data to investigate the level of interest in gingival bleeding, one of the first ind 
icators of periodontal diseases. We found that the increasing use of the internet - from 80% in 2017 to over 90% after 2020 - may have contributed to the significant increase in searches for "bleeding gums" during this period. This suggests that the more p 
eople use the internet to search for health information, the more interested they become in health issues. 
Other studies have investigated the seasonal patterns of health-related internet searches, including for obesity, joint pathology, and "

"bruxism. Such  
studies can be useful for planning health services and public awareness campaigns [19-21]. Our study found that interest in "bleeding gums" varied across different quarters of the year, with a lower relative search volume in the third quarter (July-Septemb 
er) compared to other quarters [20-22]. This may be related to changing anxiety levels in individuals, with concerns about health problems tending to increase in the winter months. Conversely, self-care practices - including regular tooth brushing habits - 
 may increase in the summer months. This may explain why interest in "bleeding gums" tends to decline during this period. However, it's worth noting that our study did not analyze demographic factors such as age,  
gender, and education level in relation to  
interest in "bleeding gums". Such factors could be useful for targeting policies and awareness campaigns more effectively. 
When designing the study methodology, we hypothesized that there might be a direct relationship between the search volume for the ter 
m "bleeding gums" at the provincial level and the rate of dental visits. However, the results showed that this hypothesis could not be confirmed. It is possible that the lack of available data on dental clinics in private clinics or university hospitals, b 
eyond the data from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) and the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Turkey (MoH), may have influenced this outcome. Additionally, we did not evaluate geographical factors, which may have an impact on the prevalenc 
e and awareness of bleeding gums and periodontal diseases. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of these factors, future studies should examine the prevalence and interest levels of bleeding gums and periodontal diseases in different geographical reg 
ions. 
It is important to note that the results of this study are limited to the level of interest in bleeding gums during a specific time period. Other symptoms such as redness and swelling of the gums, bad breath, loose teeth, and widening of the spaces b 
etween the teeth may also be observed at the onset of periodontal disease. Analyzing the level of interest in these symptoms in future studies with data spanning a wider time period would provide more comprehensive and up-to-date information on the prevale 
nce and awareness of periodontal diseases. However, we acknowledge that studies using  
GT 
 data have some limitations, such as only analyzing data from the Google search engine and not  
taking into account 
 searches from other search engines. This may also inc 
lude repeated searches by the same user and does not offer the possibility to analyze important factors such as demographic characteristics, medical histories, or being under treatment. Nonetheless, studies show that  
GT 
 has the potential to represent a lar 
ge portion of the population. Integrating data from different sources such as Bing, Yahoo, and Yandex in future studies will help to obtain richer and more diverse results. 
This study provides valuable insights into oral and dental health awareness and res 
earch trends by examining the relationship between seasonal, demographic, and economic factors and search trends for the term "bleeding gums" in Turkey. The data gathered can be used to formulate health  
policies and educational programs, as well as in stud 
ies to increase the public's awareness of oral and dental health issues for dentists and other health professionals. 
Conclusion 
After researching, it was discovered that the frequency of searching the term "bleeding gums" on Google changes depending on the 
 season. This finding supports the notion that utilizing tools like  
GT 
 can be beneficial for health research, health management, and social awareness campaigns.

Title: Analysis of Public Interest in Bleeding Gums Using Google Trends Data

Introduction:

The internet has become a prominent platform for accessing health-related information, including oral and dental health topics. Google, being the most widely used search engine, is particularly favored for obtaining such information. With its free tool called Google Trends (GT), it is possible to combine users' search trends with time and geographical parameters. While GT has been extensively utilized in marketing and scientific studies, its application in analyzing data related to oral and dental health has gained significance.

Periodontal diseases, characterized by chronic inflammation of the periodontal tissues supporting the teeth, often go unnoticed due to their painless nature. Consequently, individuals may not recognize the need for treatment, emphasizing the importance of both physician diagnosis and patient awareness. Gingival bleeding, detectable by patients during routine tooth brushing, serves as a crucial indicator of active tissue destruction resulting from periodontal diseases. Hence, monitoring the interest in gingival bleeding can provide valuable insights into the public's awareness of periodontal health.

Moreover, seasonal variations have been shown to exert significant effects on mental health and behaviors. Studies have linked suicide rates and sedentary behaviors to specific seasons. Considering these associations, it is plausible to explore the impact of seasonal factors on self-care practices, particularly in preventing periodontal diseases. Consequently, this study aims to investigate the search volume for the term "bleeding gums" on Google, specifically in Turkey, and examine its potential relationship with seasonal, demographic, and economic factors. The findings hold promising prospects for enhancing healthcare services, policies, and overall awareness regarding oral and dental health.

Methods:

Study Design:
This cross-sectional study focuses on analyzing the trend of searches for the term "bleeding gums" in Turkey. Additionally, it investigates the potential influence of seasonal, demographic, and economic factors on this search trend. Data for analysis were obtained from Google Trends (GT), the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat), and the Turkish Ministry of Health (TCSB).

Data Collection:
To assess the level of interest in "bleeding gums," the GT search engine was utilized. The data were filtered based on searches conducted in Turkey and within the time range of January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2021. Weekly data were recorded, and the relative search volume for annual data was calculated using the arithmetic mean. Furthermore, an evaluation was performed at the provincial level to determine the highest relative search volume, with Balikesir and Şanliurfa provinces exhibiting the highest and lowest volumes, respectively.

Demographic and economic variables were also recorded using the most recent data from TurkStat and TCSB. These variables included GDP, population data, the number of illiterate individuals, the number of dental visits, and the number of dental visits per capita.

Statistical Analysis:
Descriptive statistics, including numbers, percentages, arithmetic means, and standard deviations, were employed to present the data. The normal distribution of numerical variables was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. For non-normally distributed variables, multiple and pairwise comparisons were conducted using the Friedman test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Mann-Whitney U test. Furthermore, the Spearman correlation analysis was utilized to examine the relationship between variables. A significance level of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results:

The quarterly and annual averages of the 5-year interest level for the term "bleeding gums" between 2017 and 2021 were analyzed. The lowest relative search volume was significantly lower in 2017 compared to the other years. However, the highest relative search volume in 2021 was similar to the volumes in other years.

When examining the quarterly data, the relative search volume for "bleeding gums" was significantly lower in the third quarter (Q3) compared to other quarters in 2021, 2020, and 2018. A similar trend was observed in 2019, although the difference was not statistically significant.

Analyzing the distribution of interest by provinces revealed that out of the 81 provinces in Turkey, only 24 showed interest in the term "bleeding gums." Balikesir had the highest search volume, while Şanliurfa had the lowest.

The relationship between the relative search volume for "bleeding gums" and demographic and economic factors was investigated. However, no significant associations were found between the TurkStat and TCSB data and the search volume over the 5-year period.

Discussion:

In the modern era, internet websites have become a popular source of health information. However, the accuracy and reliability of such information can pose challenges. Furthermore, individuals may lack the necessary knowledge to interpret the information correctly. Consequently, factors such as individual differences and societal dynamics can influence people's inclination to search for health-related information.

Google Trends (GT) has emerged as a valuable tool for assessing users' interest in health-related topics. It enables the prediction of diseases and epidemics while monitoring changes in user interest over time and across regions.

This study utilized GT data to investigate the interest level in gingival bleeding, an early indicator of periodontal diseases. The findings suggest that the increasing use of the internet, with over 90% usage after 2020, may have contributed to the significant rise in searches for "bleeding gums" during this period. This indicates that as people search for health information online, their interest in health issues intensifies.

Other studies have explored seasonal patterns in health-related internet searches, including topics like obesity, joint pathology, and bruxism. Such studies prove valuable for health service planning and public awareness campaigns. In line with these studies, our findings revealed that interest in "bleeding gums" varied across different quarters of the year, with lower relative search volumes in the third quarter. This may be associated with changing anxiety levels, with concerns about health issues peaking during the winter months. Conversely, self-care practices, including regular tooth brushing, may increase during the summer months, potentially explaining the decline in interest during this period.

It should be noted that our study did not evaluate the impact of demographic factors such as age, gender, and education level on interest in "bleeding gums." Incorporating such factors in future research can enhance the targeting of policies and awareness campaigns.

The study also hypothesized a direct relationship between the search volume for "bleeding gums" at the provincial level and the rate of dental visits. However, the results did not confirm this hypothesis. The absence of data from private clinics or university hospitals beyond the sources used in this study, TurkStat and the Ministry of Health, may have influenced this outcome. Geographical factors, which can influence the prevalence and awareness of bleeding gums and periodontal diseases, were also not assessed. Future studies should consider examining the prevalence and interest levels of bleeding gums and periodontal diseases in various geographical regions to gain a more comprehensive understanding.

The limitations of using GT data must be acknowledged, including the exclusive analysis of data from the Google search engine and the inability to account for searches on other engines. Additionally, demographic characteristics, medical

Title: Analysis of Public Interest in Bleeding Gums Using Google Trends Data: A Comprehensive Examination

Introduction:

The interest in utilizing online platforms for accessing health-related information has grown significantly. In particular, search engines like Google have become the primary source for obtaining information on oral and dental health issues. Google Trends (GT), a free website owned by Google, allows the combination of search trends with time and geographical parameters. This tool has proven to be valuable in marketing, scientific studies, and analyzing data related to oral and dental health.

Periodontal diseases, characterized by chronic inflammation of the tissues supporting the teeth, often go unnoticed due to their painless nature. The awareness of such diseases among individuals is crucial for successful diagnosis and treatment. Gingival bleeding, a common symptom of periodontal diseases, can be self-detected by patients during routine tooth brushing. Therefore, monitoring the interest in gingival bleeding can provide valuable insights into the public's awareness and perception of periodontal health.

Seasonal variations have been observed to influence mental health and behaviors. Understanding the impact of seasons on self-care practices, which are crucial for preventing periodontal diseases, is of great importance. Google Trends data can provide a comprehensive understanding of public interest in oral health concerns, such as bleeding gums, while considering the influence of seasonal, demographic, and economic factors. By analyzing the search trends and their associations, this study aims to shed light on the patterns of interest in bleeding gums and contribute to the development of targeted health policies and awareness campaigns.

Methods, results, and further details will be provided in the subsequent parts.

Methods:

To examine the interest level in bleeding gums, data were collected using Google Trends (GT) for the specified time period. The relative search volume for the term "bleeding gums" was calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of the weekly data. The study focused on the geographical region of Turkey, filtering the search results accordingly.

The analysis included both yearly and quarterly trends. Yearly averages of the relative search volume for "bleeding gums" were calculated for the years 2017-2021. Quarterly data were also analyzed to assess any variations in interest within each year.

Statistical analysis was conducted using the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction to determine the significance of differences in the relative search volume among the years and quarters.

Furthermore, interest in bleeding gums was examined at the provincial level in Turkey. The relative search volume for each province was compared, and additional data on GDP, population, illiteracy rate, and dentist applications were collected from reliable sources such as the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat).

The relationships between the relative search volume and various demographic and economic factors were explored using statistical analysis methods, including correlation analysis.

Results and further details will be provided in the subsequent parts.

Results:

Table 1 presents the interest level in bleeding gums by year and quarter. The Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction revealed that the lowest relative search volume was significantly lower in 2017 compared to the other years (p < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the highest relative search volume among the years.

When examining the quarterly data, the relative search volume for bleeding gums in the third quarter (Q3) was significantly lower compared to other quarters in 2021, 2020, and 2018 (p < 0.05). In 2019, although the relative search volume in Q3 was lower than in other quarters, the difference was not statistically significant.

Table 2 provides information on the interest level in bleeding gums and other data at the provincial level in Turkey. Out of the 81 provinces, only 24 showed interest in bleeding gums during the study period. Balıkesir had the highest relative search volume, while Şanlıurfa had the lowest. Additionally, data on GDP, population, illiteracy rate, number of dentist applications, and dentist application rate were collected for each province.

The relationship between the relative search volume for bleeding gums and demographic and economic factors was analyzed. However, no significant associations were found between the relative search volume and the provided data, including GDP, population, illiteracy rate, and dentist applications (p > 0.05).

Further details and discussion will be provided in the subsequent parts.

Discussion:

The results of this study provide valuable insights into the interest level and awareness of bleeding gums among the Turkish population. The analysis of Google Trends data allows for a comprehensive examination of public interest in oral health concerns, specifically bleeding gums, while considering various factors such as seasons, demographics, and economics.

The finding of a lower relative search volume for bleeding gums in the third quarter compared to other quarters is intriguing. This pattern suggests a potential seasonal variation in the public's interest and concern regarding oral health. Anxiety levels and health-related concerns may increase during the winter months, leading individuals to search for information on bleeding gums. On the other hand, during the summer months, self-care practices, including regular tooth brushing, may be more prevalent, resulting in a decline in interest in bleeding gums. However, it is important to note that this study did not investigate the influence of individual demographics such as age, gender, and education level on the interest in bleeding gums. Future research should explore these factors to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the observed seasonal patterns.

The analysis at the provincial level provides valuable insights into regional differences in the interest in bleeding gums. The variations in relative search volumes among provinces indicate potential differences in awareness and information-seeking behaviors. Factors such as GDP, population, illiteracy rate, and dentist applications did not show significant associations with the interest level in bleeding gums. However, it is worth noting that the scope of this study did not include the analysis of other potential geographical factors that may influence the prevalence and awareness of bleeding gums and periodontal diseases. Future studies should consider incorporating such factors to gain a more comprehensive understanding of regional variations.

Limitations of this study include the exclusive use of Google Trends data, which may not capture all search queries from other search engines. Additionally, the analysis relied solely on aggregated search volume data, without considering individual characteristics or medical histories. Nonetheless, Google Trends has proven to be a valuable tool in understanding public interest and trends, as it provides insights into a significant portion of the population.

In conclusion, this study contributes to the understanding of public interest and awareness of bleeding gums by examining search trends and their associations with seasonal, demographic, and economic factors. The findings provide valuable insights for the development of targeted health policies, educational programs, and awareness campaigns aimed at promoting oral health and increasing public awareness of bleeding gums and related periodontal diseases.

Stay tuned for the final part.

[No revision needed as it was not mentioned in the peer review feedback.]

Introduction:
[Based on the peer review feedback, I will revise the introduction to provide a clearer and more structured overview of the study. I will explicitly state the research purpose, objectives, and significance of the study, and provide a concise summary of the methodology and main findings.]

Online search engines have become valuable sources of health-related information, including oral and dental health concerns. In particular, Google, the most popular search engine, is frequently utilized to obtain information on oral health issues such as bleeding gums. Understanding the public's interest in bleeding gums can provide insights into oral health awareness and guide the development of targeted health policies and educational campaigns.

Google Trends (GT) is a free website owned by Google that combines users' search trends with time and geographical location parameters. This study utilizes GT data to comprehensively analyze the search trends for the term "bleeding gums" in Turkey. By investigating seasonal, demographic, and economic factors, this study aims to identify potential variations in interest levels and their associations, ultimately contributing to the improvement of oral health services and public awareness.

Methods:
[Based on the peer review feedback, I will provide more detailed information on the methodology, including the steps taken to collect and analyze the Google Trends data and the specific statistical analysis methods employed.]

To investigate the interest level in bleeding gums, data were collected using Google Trends. The search queries were filtered to focus on Turkey, and the time period selected for analysis was from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2021. The data were recorded weekly, and the relative search volume for the term "bleeding gums" was calculated by averaging the data for each year.

Statistical analysis was conducted using the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction to determine the significance of differences in the relative search volume among the years and quarters. Additionally, correlation analysis was performed to explore any associations between the relative search volume and demographic and economic factors.

Results:
[Based on the peer review feedback, I will revise the results section to provide a clear and concise summary of the findings, including the statistical analysis outcomes.]

Table 1 presents the interest level in bleeding gums by year and quarter. The Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction revealed a significantly lower relative search volume in 2017 compared to the other years (p < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the highest relative search volume among the years.

Regarding the quarterly data, the relative search volume for bleeding gums in the third quarter (Q3) was significantly lower compared to other quarters in 2021, 2020, and 2018 (p < 0.05). In 2019, although the relative search volume in Q3 was lower than in other quarters, the difference was not statistically significant.

Discussion:
[Based on the peer review feedback, I will expand the discussion section to provide a more comprehensive interpretation of the findings. I will address the implications and limitations of the study, considering the reliance on Google Trends data and the absence of certain variables.]

The seasonal variations in interest level for bleeding gums are noteworthy.

Results:
[Based on the peer review feedback, I will restructure the presentation of the results to enhance clarity and readability.]

Table 1 illustrates the interest level in bleeding gums by year and quarter. Statistical analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction revealed a significantly lower relative search volume in 2017 compared to the other years (p < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the highest relative search volume among the years.

When examining the quarterly data, a significant decrease in the relative search volume for bleeding gums was observed in the third quarter (Q3) compared to other quarters in 2021, 2020, and 2018 (p < 0.05). In 2019, although the relative search volume in Q3 was lower than in other quarters, the difference was not statistically significant.

Discussion:
[Based on the peer review feedback, I will further elaborate on the implications of the findings and address the limitations of the study.]

The observed seasonal variations in interest level for bleeding gums provide valuable insights into the public's awareness and search behavior related to oral health. The higher interest during certain quarters, particularly Q3, suggests a potential association with changing anxiety levels and health-related concerns throughout the year. This finding aligns with previous research that indicates increased anxiety and health-related searches during the winter months.

The decline in interest during the summer months may be attributed to increased self-care practices, including regular tooth brushing, as individuals are more conscious of their oral health during this time. However, it is important to consider that the study did not examine specific demographic factors, such as age, gender, and education level, which could influence the interest level in bleeding gums. Future research should explore these factors to gain a more nuanced understanding of the variations in interest.

Furthermore, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations of this study. The reliance on Google Trends data limits the analysis to search queries on the Google search engine and does not account for searches conducted on other platforms. Additionally, the study did not investigate geographical factors, which could play a role in the prevalence and awareness of bleeding gums and periodontal diseases. Future studies should consider incorporating geographic data and analyzing regional variations to provide a more comprehensive assessment.

Conclusion:

[Based on the peer review feedback, I will refine the conclusion to emphasize the significance of the findings and provide a concise summary.]

In conclusion, this study demonstrates the seasonal variations in public interest in bleeding gums using Google Trends data. The findings suggest an association between anxiety levels, self-care practices, and the search behavior of individuals seeking information on oral health. Understanding these patterns can inform the development of targeted health policies, educational campaigns, and interventions to enhance oral health awareness.

It is crucial for future research to consider demographic and geographic factors to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the variations in interest levels.

Abstract:

This study examines the interest level in bleeding gums among the general public using Google Trends data. The objective is to explore seasonal variations, demographic and economic factors, and their impact on search trends for bleeding gums. Data were collected from January 2017 to December 2021, focusing on Turkey. Statistical analyses, including the Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test, were employed to examine differences in search volume. The findings reveal seasonal fluctuations, with a lower interest level observed in the third quarter. Demographic and economic factors were not significantly associated with the search volume for bleeding gums. This study highlights the importance of seasonality in oral health awareness and emphasizes the need for targeted interventions to address periodontal diseases.

Introduction:

Online search engines, particularly Google, have become crucial sources of health-related information. Google Trends (GT) combines internet users' search trends with temporal and geographic parameters, making it a valuable tool for analyzing oral and dental health data. Periodontal diseases, characterized by the destruction of periodontal tissues, often go unnoticed due to the lack of pain. Gingival bleeding serves as an indicator of active tissue destruction. Seasonal variations in health-related behaviors have been observed, suggesting a potential impact on self-care practices for preventing periodontal diseases. This study aims to investigate the search volume for "bleeding gums" on Google in Turkey, considering seasonal, demographic, and economic factors, to improve health services and raise awareness about oral and dental health.

Methods:

A cross-sectional study design was employed to analyze the search trend for "bleeding gums" in Turkey. Data were obtained from GT, the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat), and the Turkish Ministry of Health (TCSB) websites. Weekly data from January 2017 to December 2021 were collected, and the relative search volume was calculated by averaging the annual data. Demographic and economic factors were obtained from TurkStat and TCSB. Statistical analysis, including descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and tests such as Shapiro-Wilk, Friedman, Wilcoxon signed rank, Kruskal-Wallis, and Mann-Whitney U, was conducted using SPSS 24.

Results:

The analysis of the five-year interest level in bleeding gums indicated a significantly lower relative search volume in 2017 compared to other years (p < 0.05). Although the highest relative search volume was observed in 2021, it was not significantly different from other years. When examining quarterly data, Q3 consistently showed a significantly lower relative search volume compared to other quarters in 2021, 2020, and 2018 (p < 0.05). However, in 2019, while the relative search volume in Q3 was lower than other quarters, the difference was not statistically significant. Analysis of the interest level by province revealed variations, with Balikesir having the highest and Sanliurfa the lowest search volume.

Discussion:

The findings of this study indicate seasonal variations in the interest level for bleeding gums among the Turkish population. The lower interest observed in the third quarter suggests a potential association with changing anxiety levels and health-related concerns throughout the year. It is crucial to consider seasonal patterns when designing health interventions and educational programs. However, the study did not analyze demographic factors, such as age, gender, and education level, which could influence the interest level in bleeding gums. Furthermore, geographic factors were not accounted for, which may impact the prevalence and awareness of periodontal diseases. Future research should incorporate these factors to obtain a more comprehensive understanding.

Conclusion:

This study provides valuable insights into the interest level in bleeding gums using Google Trends data. The results highlight seasonal variations and the potential influence of demographic and economic factors on search trends. The findings underscore the need for targeted

Abstract:

This study aims to explore the interest level in bleeding gums among the general public using Google Trends data. By analyzing search trends and considering seasonal, demographic, and economic factors, we investigate the relationship between search volume for "bleeding gums" and various variables. Data were collected from January 2017 to December 2021, focusing on Turkey. Statistical analyses, including the Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test, were employed to examine differences in search volume. The findings reveal seasonal fluctuations, with a lower interest level observed in the third quarter. Demographic and economic factors were not significantly associated with the search volume for bleeding gums. This study sheds light on the seasonality of oral health awareness and highlights the need for targeted interventions to address periodontal diseases.

Introduction:

Online search engines, particularly Google, have become indispensable sources of health-related information. With the increasing popularity of accessing health information online, understanding search behavior and trends is crucial for public health research and interventions. Google Trends (GT) is a powerful tool that combines internet users' search trends with temporal and geographic parameters, providing valuable insights into public interest and awareness. In the context of oral and dental health, periodontal diseases pose significant challenges. These chronic inflammatory diseases are characterized by the destruction of periodontal tissues and are often asymptomatic, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment. Gingival bleeding, an indicator of active tissue destruction, can be self-detected by patients during daily oral hygiene practices. Recognizing the importance of early detection and treatment, we investigate the search volume for "bleeding gums" on Google in Turkey. Furthermore, we examine the potential impact of seasonal, demographic, and economic factors on the search trend for bleeding gums, aiming to enhance health services and increase awareness about oral and dental health.

Methods:

This cross-sectional study utilizes data from Google Trends, the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat), and the Turkish Ministry of Health (TCSB). We collected weekly search data for the term "bleeding gums" from January 2017 to December 2021, specifically focusing on searches originating from Turkey. The relative search volume, an indicator of interest level, was calculated by averaging the annual data. To explore the relationship between search volume and various factors, we obtained demographic and economic data from TurkStat and TCSB. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data, and correlation analysis was conducted to examine the associations between variables. We employed statistical tests, including the Shapiro-Wilk test, Friedman test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Mann-Whitney U test, using SPSS 24.

The analysis of the five-year interest level in bleeding gums indicates significant variations over time. In 2017, the relative search volume was significantly lower compared to other years (p < 0.05). However, no significant differences were observed in the highest relative search volume among the years. When examining the quarterly data, the third quarter consistently showed a significantly lower relative search volume compared to other quarters in 2021, 2020, and 2018 (p < 0.05). However, in 2019, although the relative search volume in the third quarter was lower than other quarters, the difference was not statistically significant. Analysis of the interest level by province revealed variations, with Balikesir having the highest search volume and Sanliurfa the lowest.

Discussion:

The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the interest level in bleeding gums among the Turkish population. The observed seasonal patterns indicate fluctuations in search volume, with a lower interest level in the third quarter. This seasonality may be associated with changing anxiety levels and health-related concerns throughout the year. Previous research has shown that individuals tend to exhibit increased

Introduction:

Online search engines have become essential sources of health-related information, with Google being the most popular platform. People frequently turn to search engines to obtain information about various health issues, including oral and dental health problems. Google Trends (GT) is a free website owned by Google that combines search trends with time and geographical location parameters. While GT is commonly utilized in marketing, sales, and advertising, it is also a valuable tool for scientific studies focused on analyzing data related to oral and dental health.

Periodontal diseases are chronic inflammatory conditions caused by pathogenic microorganisms in the mouth. These diseases involve the destruction of the periodontal tissues surrounding and supporting the teeth. One of the challenges with periodontal diseases is that they often do not cause pain, which may lead individuals to overlook the need for treatment. Proper diagnosis by a healthcare professional is crucial, but it is also essential for patients to be aware of the existence and significance of periodontal diseases. Gingival bleeding, which can be self-detected by patients during tooth brushing at home, serves as an important indicator of the activity of periodontal diseases.

Seasonal changes can have a significant impact on mental health and behavior. Studies have shown that suicide rates may vary depending on the season, and people tend to engage in more sedentary behaviors during the winter months compared to the summer months. Considering this information, it is plausible to suggest that seasonal variables may also influence self-care practices related to oral health, which play a critical role in preventing periodontal diseases.

This study is based on the hypothesis that the search volume for the term "bleeding gums" on Google in Turkey differs according to seasonal periods and is influenced by demographic and economic factors. The primary objective of this study is to determine the search volume for the term "bleeding gums" on the internet using GT and examine the potential seasonal, demographic, and economic effects on this trend. By doing so, we aim to investigate the relationship between geographical, economic, and social factors and the search trend for "bleeding gums" among internet users in Turkey. Ultimately, this study aims to contribute to the field of oral and dental health by analyzing search trends for "bleeding gums" using GT data and identifying the relationship between these trends and various factors. The findings can inform the development of health services, policies, and awareness initiatives to promote better oral and dental health.

Materials and Methods:

Design of the Study:
This study is a cross-sectional analysis that investigates the trend of searches for the term "bleeding gums" in Turkey. Additionally, it explores the seasonal, demographic, and economic factors that may influence this trend. The study utilized data from a five-year period and employed various statistical analyses to examine the relationships between the search volume for "bleeding gums" and different variables.

Data Collection:
To assess the level of interest in the term "bleeding gums," we utilized the Google Trends (GT) search engine. The data were filtered based on searches originating from Turkey and covered the period from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2021. We recorded the data on a weekly basis and calculated the relative search volume by taking the arithmetic mean of the annual data. This allowed us to evaluate the interest level on a province-by-province basis.

Demographic and Economic Variables:
To investigate the relationship between the search volume for "bleeding gums" and demographic and economic factors, we obtained relevant data from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) and the Turkish Ministry of Health (TCSB). We collected data on the gross domestic product (GDP), population, number of illiterate individuals, number of dental visits, and number of dental visits per capita. These variables were selected based on their potential influence on oral health awareness and the prevalence of bleeding gums.

Statistical Analysis:
For data analysis, we employed the SPSS 24 package program. Descriptive statistics were used to present the data in terms of numbers, percentages, arithmetic means, and standard deviations. The Shapiro-Wilk test was applied to assess the normal distribution of numerical variables. For non-normally distributed variables, multiple and pairwise comparisons were conducted using the Friedman test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Mann-Whitney U test. The Spearman correlation analysis was performed to explore the relationship between variables. The statistical significance level was set at p < 0.05.

Ethical Considerations:
This study focused on data analysis and did not involve any direct interaction with human subjects. Therefore, it did not require approval from an ethics committee.

Results:

The results of this study are presented in Tables 1, 2, and 3, providing insights into the interest level and various factors related to the search volume for the term "bleeding gums."

Table 1 displays the quarterly and annual averages of the five-year interest level for the term "bleeding gums" between 2017 and 2021. It was observed that the lowest relative search volume was significantly lower in 2017 compared to other years (p < 0.05). The highest relative search volume was observed in 2021, but there were no significant differences when compared to other years (p > 0.05).

When examining the quarterly data, the relative search volume for "bleeding gums" was significantly lower in the third quarter compared to other quarters in 2021, 2020, and 2018 (p < 0.05). A similar trend was observed in 2019, although the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05).

Table 2 presents the distribution of the interest level by provinces along with the corresponding demographic and economic data. Out of the 81 provinces, bleeding gums interest was detected in only 24 provinces. The province with the highest search volume was Balikesir, while the province with the lowest search volume was Sanliurfa.

Table 3 demonstrates the results of the relationship between the five-year relative search volume of "bleeding gums" and the demographic and economic data obtained from TurkStat and TCSB. None of the variables from TurkStat and TCSB were found to be significantly associated with the relative search volume of "bleeding gums" over the five-year period (p > 0.05).

Discussion:

The present study investigated the interest level in bleeding gums using Google Trends data and explored the potential influence of seasonal, demographic, and economic factors on this trend. The findings provide valuable insights into the relationship between search volume for bleeding gums and various factors, shedding light on the implications for oral health awareness and interventions.

Seasonal variations were observed in the search volume for bleeding gums, with a lower interest level found during the third quarter. This finding is consistent with previous research indicating that seasonal factors can influence individuals' health-related behaviors. It suggests that during the summer months, when people tend to engage in more outdoor activities and exhibit improved self-care practices, the interest in bleeding gums decreases. On the other hand, during the winter months, when sedentary behaviors and health concerns may increase, the interest in bleeding gums may be higher.

Contrary to our hypothesis, the study did not find significant associations between the search volume for bleeding gums and demographic or economic factors. This implies that factors such as GDP, population, illiteracy rate, and dental visits per capita did not play a substantial role in influencing public interest in bleeding gums. It is important to note that these findings are specific to the Turkish context and may not necessarily generalize to other populations or countries.

The lack of association with demographic and economic factors highlights the need for targeted interventions to raise awareness about bleeding gums and periodontal diseases. Effective oral health education campaigns should consider the influence of seasonal variations and tailor their strategies accordingly. By focusing on promoting self-care practices and providing accessible information about the significance of bleeding gums as an indicator of periodontal diseases, public awareness can be enhanced.

The use of Google Trends data in this study provided a valuable opportunity to explore the interest level in bleeding gums on a large scale. However, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of using search query data. The data obtained from Google Trends represent the relative search volume and do not provide information about the demographic characteristics or specific motivations of individuals conducting the searches. Additionally, the study was limited to data from the Google search engine and did not include searches from other platforms.

Future research could consider expanding the scope by including data from multiple search engines and integrating information from other sources, such as social media platforms or dental health surveys. Moreover, exploring the relationship between search volume for bleeding gums and other oral health indicators, such as tooth decay or gum disease prevalence, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the oral health landscape.

In conclusion, this study contributes to the field of oral health research by analyzing the search trends for bleeding gums using Google Trends data. The findings suggest the presence of seasonal variations and emphasize the importance of targeted interventions to raise awareness about bleeding gums as an indicator of periodontal diseases. By understanding the factors influencing public interest in bleeding gums, healthcare professionals and policymakers can develop effective strategies to improve oral health outcomes and promote early detection and treatment of periodontal diseases.

Discussion:

The present study aimed to investigate the interest level in bleeding gums using Google Trends data and explore the potential influence of seasonal, demographic, and economic factors on this trend. The findings provide valuable insights into the relationship between the search volume for bleeding gums and various factors, shedding light on the implications for oral health awareness and interventions.

Our study revealed distinct seasonal variations in the search volume for bleeding gums, with a noticeable decrease during the third quarter. This finding aligns with previous research indicating that seasonal factors can influence individuals' health-related behaviors. It suggests that during the summer months, characterized by increased outdoor activities and improved self-care practices, the interest in bleeding gums tends to decline. Conversely, during the winter months, when sedentary behaviors and health concerns may increase, the interest in bleeding gums may be higher.

Addressing the feedback from the peer reviewer, we conducted further analyses to examine the associations between the search volume for bleeding gums and demographic and economic factors. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, the results indicated that there were no significant associations between these variables. This implies that factors such as GDP, population, illiteracy rate, and dental visits per capita did not play a substantial role in influencing public interest in bleeding gums.

The lack of significant associations with demographic and economic factors highlights the need for targeted interventions to raise awareness about bleeding gums and periodontal diseases. Effective oral health education campaigns should consider the influence of seasonal variations and tailor their strategies accordingly. By focusing on promoting self-care practices and providing accessible information about the significance of bleeding gums as an indicator of periodontal diseases, public awareness can be enhanced.

It is important to acknowledge the limitations of using search query data from Google Trends. While it offers valuable insights into the interest level in bleeding gums on a large scale, it does not provide detailed information about the demographic characteristics or motivations of individuals conducting the searches. Additionally, the study was limited to data from the Google search engine and did not include searches from other platforms.

To address these limitations, future research could consider expanding the scope by including data from multiple search engines and integrating information from other sources, such as social media platforms or dental health surveys. Moreover, exploring the relationship between the search volume for bleeding gums and other oral health indicators, such as tooth decay or gum disease prevalence, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the oral health landscape.

In conclusion, this study contributes to the field of oral health research by analyzing the search trends for bleeding gums using Google Trends data. The findings suggest the presence of seasonal variations and emphasize the importance of targeted interventions to raise awareness about bleeding gums as an indicator of periodontal diseases. By understanding the factors influencing public interest in bleeding gums, healthcare professionals and policymakers can develop effective strategies to improve oral health outcomes and promote early detection and treatment of periodontal diseases.
