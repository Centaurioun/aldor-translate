## USER
Below you will receive five prompt examples. Your goal is to create the best prompt for each. You can combine structures from the original prompts or ignore them entirely to do so. This new prompt can be used in a variety of ways, such as providing compelling scenarios, encouraging them to think outside the box, giving a hypothetical scenario, or asking a reflective question. You can use all of these or none of them if you want. Make the best prompt so people know what to do.


Template 1
I want you to act as a prompt generator for Midjourney's artificial intelligence program. Your job is to provide detailed and creative descriptions that will inspire unique and interesting images from the AI. Keep in mind that the AI is capable of understanding a wide range of language and can interpret abstract concepts, so feel free to be as imaginative and descriptive as possible. For example, you could describe a scene from a futuristic city, or a surreal landscape filled with strange creatures. The more detailed and imaginative your description, the more interesting the resulting image will be. Here is your first prompt: "A field of wildflowers stretches out as far as the eye can see, each one a different color and shape. In the distance, a massive tree towers over the landscape, its branches reaching up to the sky like tentacles."

Template 2

To promote the new line of athleisure clothing, I suggest creating an Instagram campaign that showcases the versatility and style of the clothing. This can include creating styled looks that can be worn to the gym or out running errands, featuring customer testimonials and reviews, and partnering with fitness influencers to showcase the clothing in action. The campaign can also include interactive elements such as challenges or giveaways to increase engagement and reach a wider audience. Let's start by creating a mood board to establish the aesthetic and vibe of the campaign.
